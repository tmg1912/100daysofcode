Step 1 - Check out how the game play works
1. A turtle moves forwards when you press the "Up" key. It can only move forwards, not back, left or right.

2. Cars are randomly generated along the y-axis and will move from the right edge of the screen to the left edge.
3. When the turtle hits the top edge of the screen, it moves back to the original position and the player levels up. On the next level, the car speed increases.

4. When the turtle collides with a car, it's game over and everything stops.

Step 2 - Break down the Problem

If you haven't already, download the starting project here and open it inside PyCharm.

The first step of creating any large project is to breakdown the problem into smaller, bite-sized chunks. Add the following comments to the starting code and try to tackle them one-by-one.

Create a turtle player that starts at the bottom of the screen and listen for the "Up" keypress to move the turtle north. If you get stuck, check the video walkthrough in Step 3.
